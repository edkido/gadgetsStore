FEATURES
 - Responsive Design: Gadgets Store is optimized for seamless viewing across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
 - Dynamic Pages: The application consists of multiple pages including the Home page, Phones, Tablets, and Accessories pages, providing users with a smooth navigation experience.
 - User Interaction: Users can engage with the platform by 'liking' articles, which are then stored locally and displayed on the Favorites page for easy access.
 - Shopping Cart: Gadgets Store includes a fully functional shopping cart feature, allowing users to add desired items for purchase. Cart items are stored locally to maintain persistence across sessions.
 - Touch Interactions: Gadgets Store enhances user experience on mobile devices with Swipers, enabling smooth touch interactions for navigating through product carousels and image galleries.
 - Centralized State Management: Gadgets Store utilizes a main store state using Context, allowing for centralized management of application data. This ensures consistency and facilitates efficient data sharing between components.
 - Modern Technologies: Gadgets Store utilizes a stack of modern technologies:
    - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a declarative and component-based approach to building UIs.
    - React Router: A routing library for React applications, enabling navigation between different components/pages.
    - TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity by catching errors early in the development process.
    - SCSS: A powerful CSS preprocessor that enhances maintainability and reusability of stylesheets through features like variables, mixins, and nested rules.
    - BEM Methodology: Gadgets Store follows the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes, promoting consistency and clarity in the codebase.
